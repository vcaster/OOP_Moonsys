            <p><strong>Hi,</strong></p>

<p>There is something which you need to know about XAMP. </p>

<p>Currently, there is XAMP 3.2.2 is the latest version out there which supports PHP 7.1. </p>

<p>As this course has designed for a complete beginners also for those who don't have a programming background. That's why this course uses XAMP 3.2.1 earlier version  with PHP 5.6. </p>

<p>All the PHP code is fully supported in both version but for database its bit different. XAMP with PHP 5.6 can let you work with database (SQL) by using mysql, however, XAMP with PHP 7.1 can only let you work with database (SQL) by using <strong>mysqli not mysql</strong>.  And <strong>mysqli syntax is bit difficult for beginners. </strong></p>

<p>That is why this whole <strong><em>course uses XAMP with PHP 5.6 with mysql</em></strong> not mysqli.</p>

<p>I will recommend you to use<strong> PHP 5.6 </strong>with this course so that you will learn and wont get stuck in tricky mysqli syntax. </p>

<p>After completing this course you can easily work and shift later in future on mysqli with little work.</p>

<p>SO, <strong>" IT'S Better to get Started Instead Being STUCK"</strong></p>

<p>So Dont get Stuck.</p>

<p> <strong>Use following version</strong> of XAMP and download it for FREE</p>

<p><strong>Download XAMP SERVER with PHP 5.6 and Install it</strong></p>
